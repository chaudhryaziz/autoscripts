MundaneBanisher: Automate the boring in your life and banish all the mundane that wastes time!

The purpose of this project is to develop a suite of automation scripts to help automate the mundane tasks that are repeated during a typical week. 

If tracked, these repeated tasks take up a large portion of time. The more automation, the more time that can be recovered. 

Please feel free to use the following scripts to help automate the mundane tasks in your life. 

Each folder contains a general category of automation possibilities with more details in the individual folders and scripts themselves.
