Description: 

Many times one is watching video, they have to deal with slow internet connection or throttling by their ISP. 

Another issue is privacy relating to the video site tracking views,stats about your usage etc. 

One way to avoid these issues and provide video that you want to watch in a more streamlined fashion is to have a high-speed server connected to an internet backbone such as a seedbox. 

The seedbox can then download the video and then you can download the video directly from the seedbox likely bypassing any ISP inflicted throttling, garuanteed saturation of your avalible bandwidth to download the video and preventing any direct tracking of your usage by the provider.
